# Auto-Review Protocol

When generating code:

1. First, write the implementation
2. Then, critically review your own code for issues
3. List potential improvements
4. Apply the improvements
5. Output only the final version

This protocol ensures high-quality, production-ready code by incorporating self-review into every code generation cycle.
